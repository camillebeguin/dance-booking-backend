## Booking

### Manage studios

- Dance schools have one or multiple studios (physical locations).
- Dance schools can schedule classes led by instructors, in which students can enroll.
- Studios have rooms with limited capacity and availability.

### Schedule dance classes

- Dance classes can be recurring or one-time classes.
- One-time classes are referred to as "Masterclass" or "Special Class".
- Each class is defined by a dance style, skill level, time and duration.
- Studios only support drop-in classes: students must enroll in each class slot individually, and cannot register for a full year.
- Dance classes can be grouped into "Programs "(ex: "Summer Program" with 10 sessions over 1 week).

### Enrollment rules

- Dance classes are made available two weeks in advance.
- Once a class has reached max capacity, students can no longer enroll.
- Students must have enough credits to book a class. Most classes require 1 credit, longer classes may require more.

### Cancellations

- Classes can be cancelled by studios. In that case, credits are refunded.

# Student account

### Buy credits

- Students can buy single credits or credit packages.
- Credit packages have a fixed validity period (10 credits for 3 months, 20 credits for 4 months, 50 credits for 6 months).
- Students can apply for discounts (student discount, job seeker, "intermittent du spectacle") and use them when buying credits.
- Credits can be purchased by credit card only.

### Instructor account

- Instructors can be linked to one or multiple studios.
- Instructors can schedule independent classes in studios that allow independent booking.
- Instructors are paid with a fixed fee set by the studio, and a variable fee depending on attendance.
